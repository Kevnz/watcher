 Watcher is a simple module who will be watching a given process, due to maxmem use or disk space abuse, then It'll emit a SIGINT Sign then it'll send a notice to the master process. To restart the process.

 The main purpose of this module is because we, at nodester, are needed to control the memory use by users apps. And disk space in use.
